# Smart-Car
The project aims to build an autonomous car prototype using Raspberry Pi as a processing chip. Infrared sensors along with an ultrasonic sensor is used to provide necessary data from the real world to the car. The car is capable of reaching the given destination safely and intelligently thus avoiding the risk of human errors. 
An autonomous car (Smart Car)is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input.The project uses various components like gps for tracking the location,ultrasonic and ir sensors for obstacle detection,magnatomater for the orientation,motors,ic,etc.
The biggest benefits of such smart cars are that they will help to make roads safer and people's lives easier.
